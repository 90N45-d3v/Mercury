Mercury is my DIY communication system. It's a webserver, so you can access it from any possible device.<br>Of course it is not as secure as Telegram or similar messengers (at least I hope so), but I still try to make it as secure as possible. Mercury is open source. You can host it at home on a Raspberry Pi or with the online hoster of your choice.<br>You have full control of it.
